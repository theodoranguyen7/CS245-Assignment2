# CS245-Assignment2

*I did not consider duplicates, because I assumed the files are well-behaved.
*I also implemented a hash map because I intially believed that we were considering duplicates for this Assignment. So, I believed

*I am using my three late days because I was struggling hardcore with this assignment on top with work from other classes.
